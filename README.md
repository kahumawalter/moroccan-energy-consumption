# Moroccan-energy-consumption

This Moroccan electricity consumption dataset, courtesy of Maven Analytics, revealed surprising insights. One of the most striking findings was the peak in power consumption at 8 pm every day. Additionally, the months of July and August saw the highest electricity consumption levels but what shocked me was the realization that temperature and power consumption had a moderate correlation which I had not expected. 

The dataset covers electricity consumption across three zones in Morocco, along with environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. My analysis focused on identifying seasonal patterns in electricity consumption at hourly, weekly, and monthly intervals, as well as exploring correlations between different variables and patterns across the three zones.
